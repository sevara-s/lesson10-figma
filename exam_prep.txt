Javascript has two main catagories of data types.

1)Primitive data types:
Primitive data types are basic types that represnet single values . They are immutable they can't be changed once they are created. and are sorted  directly in the variable's memory location.

Primitive data types:
1. String
A sequence of characters enclosed ine aither single quotes(') or double quotes (") or backticks(`)
2.Number-->represent numeric values ,whether integer or float-point
3.BigInt-->a newer data type for representing large integers beyond the Number range(2 53)-1
4.Boolen-->boolen represents one of two values true or false
5.undefined-->variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
6.Symbol
7.null-->represents an intentional absence of any value . It's a falsy value ,often used to signify that a variable has no value.


2)Non-Primitive data types or reference types 
this type of data types are more complex types . They can hold multiple values and are mutabel can be changed .  When we assign a reference type variable to another variable the second variable points to the same memory location as the first.

List of non-primitive data types:
1)Objects.
2)Array.
3)Funciton.


Differences between var,let,const,

1)var - old way of declaring variables in js 
function-scoped.
hoisted 
can be re-declared.
2)let - modern way of declaring variables.
block-scoped
hoisted
can be updated  but not re-declared
3)const -constant variable
block-scoped
hoisted
cannot be reassigned
must be initialized

Funtions in js:

1)Function declaration
a funttion declaraton is the most common way to define a function in js 

funciton Myfunciton(parametres){

}
2)Function expression is when you assign a funciton to a variable , Function created in this way are anonymous they don't have a name and   are  typically used as arguments to other  functions
const functonnamec= (parametres)=>{

};
